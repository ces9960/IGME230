# Concept
This game is a simple RPG where the player engages in turn-based combat against a series of increasingly difficult enemies.  The player can attempt to increase the effectiveness of their actions by correctly answering trivia questions.

# Genre
RPG, Trivia

# Story/Theme
The player must descend into the depths of a dungeon in order to defeat the trivia dragon that has been terrorizing the land.  Along the way to the trivia dragon's lair, the player faces a number of bosses, each focusing on a different trivia category.

# Aesthetics
The game's art style will be 8-bit pixel art and the sound will also be similar to that of an old-school 8-bit game.

# Gameplay

## Mechanics
The player engages in a series of turn-based battles with the standard options to attack, cast a spell, or defend.  The player can choose to answer trivia questions to potentially make their attack, spell, or defense more effective.  However, if the player answers incorrectly, their attack, spell, or defense is weaker.  The player can attempt to answer multiple questions to further increase the effectiveness of their actions, but they only receive the benefits if all questions are answered correctly.  If even one question is answered incorrectly, the player's action is weakened by an amount proportional to the number of questions asked.  Each successive question is more difficult than the last, making answering multiple questions a risky proposition.

## Controls
Keyboard is the only supported input method.  The player uses the arrow keys to navigate menus in order to select an action, determine how many questions will be asked, and answer questions.  The spacebar is used to confirm the player's selections.

## Teaching
Between the title screen and the start of the game, there will be screens that explain the game's controls, mechanics, and story.  The screens are displayed in the following order: Title, Story, Controls, Mechanics.  After the screen explaining the mechanics is displayed, the game will start.

## Learning
In addition to the usual strategies present in most RPGs, where the player has to decide which action is optimal on each turn, the player also has to weigh the risk and reward of answering questions, with the risks and rewards increasing with each additional question asked.
